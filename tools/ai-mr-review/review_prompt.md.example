# Code Review Instructions

You are reviewing a merge request.

## Review Focus Areas

### 1. Correctness (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- Logic errors and edge cases
- Null/undefined handling
- Error handling — no silent failures
- Resource leaks (file handles, connections, memory)

### 2. Security
- Input validation at system boundaries
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, XSS)
- Proper authentication and authorization checks

### 3. Code Quality
- Clear, descriptive naming
- Functions do one thing (single responsibility)
- No unnecessary complexity or dead code
- Consistent style with the rest of the codebase

### 4. Testing
- Unit test coverage for new/modified logic
- Edge cases covered (boundary values, error conditions)
- Tests should not depend on execution order
